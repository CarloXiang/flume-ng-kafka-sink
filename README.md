##  Flume-Kafka-sink

This is a [Flume](https://flume.apache.org) Sink implementation that can publish data to a [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org) topic.
The objective is to integrate Flume with Kafka so that pull based processing systems such as [Apache Storm](https://storm.incubator.apache.org) can process the data coming through various Flume sources such as Syslog.

## Dependency Versions

Apache Kafka - 0.8.1.1
